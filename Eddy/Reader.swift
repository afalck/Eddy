	// you dispatch a call asynchronously and then have that call dispatch the reporting in the main thread.

	// normally this is done once... for example: "go load an image from a server... when you are done display it in the GUI".
	// but I am using it here to continuously do something in the background by having it restart the process when done.
	// notice that it uses recursion instead of iteration because swift expects these closures to be fairly short lived.
	//
	// Closure: notice the {() -> Void in ...} sections.  Those are closures, which is essentially an annonymous function.
	// Swift 2 uses them often... it is worth learning about them.
